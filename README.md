## !!! NOT READY FOR USE !!!

A simple reverse proxy, intended to enable rolling updates of services behind it ... if you want a big boy reverse proxy look at NGINX or HA PROXY etc.

What this is:
- a simple reverse proxy, that passes a request along to a one of a pool of services
- a simple reverse proxy, that checks if the service is alive regularly

What this is NOT:
- an SSL endpoint
- a replacement for Nginx
- a replacement for HAProxy
- a session aware load balancer
